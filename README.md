## Project Description
This is a Java-based Blackjack game with a graphical user interface (GUI). It utilizes Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts, ArrayLists, Stacks, and custom classes (Hand, Deck, BlackJack, and Card) with custom methods.

## Getting Started
To play the game, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository from [GitHub Repo URL].
2. Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher installed on your system.
3. Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

## Running the Game
Compile and run the program by executing the appropriate commands.

## Project Structure
The project is organized as a Java project and follows the standard Java project structure:

- `src/` contains the Java source code files.
- `bin/` or `out/` (depending on your IDE) contains compiled class files.
- `lib/` (if applicable) contains external libraries used in the project.

## Game Interaction
- The GUI represents the Blackjack table.
- Click "Hit" to take another card.
- Click "Stand" to end your turn.
- Click "Double Down" to double your bet and draw one more card.
- Click "Quit" to exit the game.

## Game Rules
- The program enforces Blackjack rules, including card values and win/lose conditions.
- The goal is to beat the dealer's hand without going over 21.

## Assumptions

- The game does not support real-money betting; it's for entertainment purposes only.

## Limitations
- Single-player experience; no multiplayer support.
- No statistics or game tracking.
- No advanced strategies or card counting.
- No online play features.
- Basic GUI with button interactions.
- OOP principles and custom classes used.
